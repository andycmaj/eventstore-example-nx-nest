Error: Nest can't resolve dependencies of the GithubController (GithubService, ?). Please make sure that the argument EventStore at index [1] is available in the PullRequestsModule context.

Potential solutions:
- If EventStore is a provider, is it part of the current PullRequestsModule?
- If EventStore is exported from a separate @Module, is that module imported within PullRequestsModule?
  @Module({
    imports: [ /* the Module containing EventStore */ ]
  })
